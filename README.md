# HypermeshLatticeMesher

Tool to generate lattice Meshes from existing hex meshes in Hyperworks (for now - maybe other element types later)

## Notes (for coding)

Some notes for better understanding the code in here (mostly for myself)

### Execute

- run the module via: python -m HypermeshLatticeMesher.HypermeshLatticeMesher
- This is the top module which should contain the main logic for the program

### Tests

- run the tests via: 'python -m unittest discover'
